abstract="The slabs test is the dominant approach to determine if a ray hits an axis-aligned bounding box (axis-aligned 3D rectangle that encloses a region). There is a particularly clean way to code this algorithm that is widely used but not singled out very well in the literature, and this chapter describes it.",
